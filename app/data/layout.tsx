        <p>
WISE (Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer) is an infrared space telescope that was launched in 2009. WISE performed all sky survey in 4 bands(3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 Î¼m), ranging from mid-infrared to far-infrared. The data from WISE is used to study phenomenons in the infrared regime, including luminous infrared galaxies, distant astroids, brown dwarfs, and much more.
